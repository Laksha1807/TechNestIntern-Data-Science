Heart Disease Prediction App – Task 3 (TechNest Internship)
This is a Streamlit-based web application built as Task 3 of my Data Science Internship at TechNest. The app uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical attributes.

🔍 What it Does
The app takes user input for 13 clinical features such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, etc., and predicts whether the individual is likely to have heart disease.

🧠 How it Works
Model: Trained using a Logistic Regression classifier on a cleaned heart disease dataset.

Pipeline: Includes preprocessing using StandardScaler, and model serialization using joblib.

Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing a responsive and interactive UI for prediction.

⚙️ Features
User-friendly web form for entering medical data

Real-time predictions

Clean and responsive UI

Deployable on Streamlit Cloud

Fully integrated with GitHub
